My co-worker shared an experience of how bad relationships prevented him from building a software platform. I’d never heard of someone blaming a software failure on relationship dynamics, and it resonated with me.

Platforms are enticing because they can solve a problem once for a large number of customers--small amount of investment for big gains. But they require choreographing multiple stakeholders (people that use the platform) and teams (the people that build the platform).

Conway believed that our relational dynamics are reflected in the software we write. We’ll build reusable software when we have people working together. We’ll build one-off services when we don’t.


Human connection is important to me and I want to believe it’s important to my work.
My co-worker was eventually fired for failing to build the platform.
