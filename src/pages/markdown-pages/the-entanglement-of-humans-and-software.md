I'm on a Zoom call with my co-worker and he's telling me about a previous project. He’d been brought on to facilitate building a software platform. These platforms are enticing because they can solve a problem once for a large number of customers--small amount of investment for big gains. He mourned the fact that his leadership did not understand that building a platform required cooperation and collaboration. He was eventually let go.

Conway’s Law has a similar conjecture to my friend's observation:

We cannot hide our biases in our software. Conway’s Law states that we tend to write software that reflects our relationships with others. We’ll build reusable software when we have people working together. We’ll build one-off services when we don’t.

My parents recently asked me if I was concerned about AI. “What if we eventually rely on AI to decide who lives and who dies?” asked my Mom.

Computers can only make decisions based on what a human tells them to value. AI is like a sailboat that moves off human breath. AI is an extension of human desire. It's a fallicy to think that we can replace the bias of humans with computers and AI. I’m not concerned about AI, I'm concerned about the people behind the machines, the ones telling the computers what to do and marketing the software as an unbiased decision-maker.

If we want to solve big issues: we’ll need humans to do them. Software is not our savior, it is a tool. We’ll need people who value human flourishing, we’ll need people with an imagination for how software can help others.

Software is a human endeavor. I’m starting to believe we cannot untangle the humanity in our software--that computer problems are still human problems.
