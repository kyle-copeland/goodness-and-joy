I’d never heard of someone blaming a software failure on relationship dynamics, and it resonated with me.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“They didn’t understand how to build a platform. They had two teams with separate lists of priorities and roadmaps. Neither team wanted to work together. They didn’t realize building a platform required cooperation and collaboration.” - My co-worker</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Platforms are enticing because they can solve a problem once for a large number of customers--small amount of investment for big gains. But they require choreographing multiple stakeholders (people that use the platform) and teams (the people that build the platform).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure” - Melvin E. Conway</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Conway believed that our relational dynamics are reflected in the software we write. We’ll build reusable software when we have people working together. We’ll build one-off services when we don’t.</p>\n<p>Human connection is important to me and I want to believe it’s important to my work.\nMy co-worker was eventually fired for failing to build the platform.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 19, 2023","slug":"/the-entanglement-of-humans-and-software","title":"The entanglement of humans and software","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.4184397163120568,"src":"/static/0f31feeb10a92f6c3a47811e319db82d/14b42/blossoming-code.jpg","srcSet":"/static/0f31feeb10a92f6c3a47811e319db82d/f836f/blossoming-code.jpg 200w,\n/static/0f31feeb10a92f6c3a47811e319db82d/2244e/blossoming-code.jpg 400w,\n/static/0f31feeb10a92f6c3a47811e319db82d/14b42/blossoming-code.jpg 800w,\n/static/0f31feeb10a92f6c3a47811e319db82d/47498/blossoming-code.jpg 1200w,\n/static/0f31feeb10a92f6c3a47811e319db82d/0e329/blossoming-code.jpg 1600w,\n/static/0f31feeb10a92f6c3a47811e319db82d/90432/blossoming-code.jpg 1883w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/the-entanglement-of-humans-and-software"}},
